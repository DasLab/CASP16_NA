# Data for R1260

## Data locations

__Predictions:__ predictions of atomic ensembles from 28 prediction groups can be downloaded from https://predictioncenter.org/download_area/CASP16/predictions/R1260/.

__Base line ensembles__: Base line ensembles are derived from selection 1,000 models from the various simulations in [Kretsch et al 2025](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08855-w). They can be found at https://doi.org/10.25740/vz022mq8177. The full simulations are found at https://doi.org/10.25740/sw275qs6749.

__Cryo-EM maps:__ The cryo-em maps used as targets in R1260 can be found in [EMD-42499](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/EMD-42499) and [EMD-42498](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/EMD-42498).

__Cryo-EM derived models:__ The above cryo-EM maps were modeled in the traditional sense of placing water and magnesium ion in well-defined peaks: PDB [9CBU](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb9CBU/pdb), [9CBX](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb9CBX/pdb), [9CBW](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb9CBW/pdb), and [9CBY](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb9CBY/pdb). Due to the various biases in modeling, predicted ensembles were compared against the cryo-EM maps, not these models.

__Locally aligned neighborhoods:__ Intermediates in the process of converting atomic models to densities is the conversion to locally aligned neighborhoods which can be found XXXX.

__Atomic model derived maps:__ The predicted ensembles were converted to maps for direct comparison against the cryo-EM maps. These predicted maps can be found XXXX.
